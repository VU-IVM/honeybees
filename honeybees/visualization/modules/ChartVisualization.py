    """Each chart can visualize one or more model-level series as lines
     with the data value on the Y axis and the step number as the X axis.

    At the moment, each call to the render method returns a list of the most
    recent values of each series.

    Attributes:
        series: A list of dictionaries containing information on series to
                plot. Each dictionary must contain (at least) the "name" and
                "color" keys. The "name" value must correspond to a
                model-level series collected by the model's DataCollector, and
                "color" must have a valid HTML color.
        canvas_height, canvas_width: The width and height to draw the chart on
                                     the page, in pixels. Default to 200 x 500
        data_collector_name: Name of the DataCollector object in the model to
                             retrieve data from.
        template: "chart_module.html" stores the HTML template for the module.


    Example:
        schelling_chart = ChartModule([{"name": "happy", "color": "Black"}],
                                      data_collector_name="datacollector")

    TODO:
        Have it be able to handle agent-level variables as well.

        More Pythonic customization; in particular, have both series-level and
        chart-level options settable in Python, and passed to the front-end
        the same way that "color" is currently.
